The project integrates services with HTTP and JSON, that uses FOAAS and purgomalum api. 
The user enter a path, and if there is a correct path called from redact.py, a payload  is created and makes an HTML outline showing a message to the user copying the bootstrap styling from foaas.com and the link to website.   

How To Run
using redact URL connect to the HTTP server using redact.py/'message_param'/'subtitle_param'
first paramater, message_param, will generate a message from FOAAS ussing their API and the second parameter, subtitle_param, writes the string as a subtitle.

redact.py 
	Contains functions that make API calls to FOAAS and purgomalum
	
make_request(url, path)
	Takes url and path of a request to create a connection to the http server and load a JSON object, then returns the object data

get_censored_json(path)
	Checks if the path is valid with the first character of the string being '/', if it is not exit and output invalid path.
	If the path is '/operations' return the json data by calling make_request 
	Otherwise if the path is valid use the make_request function to collect the data with the valid path,
	then the function parses the message and it is used to make a api call to the purgomalum with the parsed message and path. 
	Then the function calls the make_request to pull the data from the updated path.
	It returns the data as a dictionary with message, and subtitle in the format {"message": data2["result"], "subtitle": data["subtitle"]}

cmd_censored_json(path)
	Prints the data of the json data from the path using get_censored_json to the console.

main()
	If length of sys.argv is not 2 it exits, if it does print data to console.

server.py
	Subclass of http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler with an implementation of the do_GET() function that retrives a path from an incoming request to make an API call to FOAAS 	  and PurgoMalum. Any of the other paths and filters from foaas produces a message with the exception of the path '/operations' and a '/' path.

class ExampleHTTPRequestHandler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler)
	Checks if path is '/operations', if it is send 404 error.
	Checks if path is '/favicon.ico', if it is send 404 error.
	Checks if path is '/', if it is send response 200 and links to foaas.com
	Otherwise send 200 response and show content using get_censored_json from redact.py

with socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), ExampleHTTPRequestHandler) as httpd:
	Connects to the http server
